Stack overflow exploit example **stack4.c** from "Writing Security Tools and Exploits" by J.Foster

1. **exploit/run_exploit** - create badfile
2. **stack4.sh** - run exploit

Do not use Linux with a kernel larger than 2.4.20 - exploit don't work (see Foster's book).
I used Red Hat 7.2, the distribution can be downloaded http://archive.download.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/7.2/de/iso/i386/.
